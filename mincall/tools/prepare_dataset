This script is responsible for preparing the basecalled dataset. It expects to be given fast5 filled folder input, reference string, and alignment .sam

It should work whether reference sequence is circular or not.

Usage:
    prepare_dataset fast5_folder reference.fa output_dir

For example let's say we have following folder:

fast5 = {a.fast5, b.fast5}

prepare_dataset fast5 ref.fa alignment.fa out

gives us out={a.ref, b.ref}
